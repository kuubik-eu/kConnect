# kConnect (Plugin is not done yet)
kuubik.eu website &amp; minecraft server account linking plugin.
This plugin generates a random code and inserts it into the database with player username. So that they can insert this code on the website. Codes can be generated and used only once and players can't delete their codes. 

**For example:** Your in-game username is *Steve* and your website username is *Chewbacca* and you want to link your accounts. To do so, you write `/genereeri` in server and you get a key, which you will go and insert in website panel. *You must not share your key with anyone unless you have activated it. Unless other player can activate your key with their website account and change your in-game password, etc.*
##

  - /kc reload - Reloads the plugin.

  - /genereeri - Generates code for player.
  - /genereeri [player] - Generates code for mentioned player *(console only)*
